Finished the tutorial at
https://www.makeschool.com/build-an-iphone-game-in-your-browser

Was a 9 step lesson that used code to control an element character in a game
called a function dashButtonPressed() from library
wrote a function elementalButtonPressed() using if-then-else statements
wrote a function swipeButtonPressed(numberOfSwipes: Int) using for-loops
Wrote a function singButtonPressed() using if-then-else & for-loops


Summarize of some concepts learned:
Variables - a way to store info
Functions - a way to reuse code or call code from other parts of the pgm
Handlers - fn that r called when a specific event occurs
Libraries - libraries store fn that someone else wrote (for u to use)
if-then-else statements - alter the flow of the pgm based on different conditions
for-loop - repeat the same chunk of code multiple times
