I finally found someone's repository on exercise 48 on git hub.
I'm currently looking at how they did the lexicon.rb
In the "Learn Ruby the Hard Way" CD we're told to create a
module, although in the example I found, they created a class.
I plan to write my code to how shaw started off in the CD, and use the example as a sort of guide.

I also continued to work on a website I found through
tumblr, this is a course on Ruby there are also other
programming languages. For the most part it was mainly
review for me because I already learned the materials
taught from "Learn Ruby the Hard Way". However, there are
some concepts that were new; such as, the .times method.
