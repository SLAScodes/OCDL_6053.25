1. My objective is go work through the Ruby textbook to focus my knowledge in this flexible language.
I'm going to upload all the Ruby exercises, with the exception of repeated practices.

2. Depending the circumstances of my progress and time, I may consider writing a more complex Ruby script of my liking.
