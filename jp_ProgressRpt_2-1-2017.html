 1 msg on Rufus - Create bootable USB drives the easy way, found @ https://rufus.akeo.ie/
 1 msg on PortableApps.com - has portable s/w apps that runs from the USB without downloading to main computer

back to the conversion of website code:
reviewed w3school "go to the top" syntax;
<h2 id="top">Top of page!</h2>  code at the top of the page
<a href="#top">Go to top</a>   code at the bottom of the page

learned that spaces between words should be replaced by %20 to ensure proper display of text in links.
